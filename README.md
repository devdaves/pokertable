Poker Table
===========

How cool would this be?
-----------------------
Imagine playing Texas Hold'em poker with your friends and you have the people at the ends of the table or new people and the dealing of the cards gets messed up.  Even worse is you finnaly got a good hand after a night of crap hands.  It's hard not be pissed off.  

Imaging now if there was a tablet in the middle of the poker table that had a deal button.  When dealing to the players they get thier cards on thier cell phone.  When its time to deal the flop the cards are displayed on the tablet and on the cell phone (no more stupid glare on the cards).  You can fold from the phone or from the tablet.  The idea is no more missed deals.  You still get to play with the physical chips but the cards are all electronic.

When?

This is an idea I have been pondering for a while and seems like a good project to start now (November 2012) and hopefully get a working model by the end of my 2012 holiday vacation (Yeah I know, what a nerd...).
